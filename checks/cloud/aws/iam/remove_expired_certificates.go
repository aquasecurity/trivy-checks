		Summary:    "Delete expired TLS certificates",
		Impact:     "Risk of misconfiguration and damage to credibility",
		Resolution: "Remove expired certificates",
		Explanation: `
Removing expired SSL/TLS certificates eliminates the risk that an invalid certificate will be
deployed accidentally to a resource such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), which can
damage the credibility of the application/website behind the ELB. As a best practice, it is
recommended to delete expired certificates.

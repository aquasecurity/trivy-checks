# METADATA
# title: AWS SQS policy document has wildcard action statement.
# description: |
#   SQS Policy actions should always be restricted to a specific set.
#   This ensures that the queue itself cannot be modified or deleted, and prevents possible future additions to queue actions to be implicitly allowed.

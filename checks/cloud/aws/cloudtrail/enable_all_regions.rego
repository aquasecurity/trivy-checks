# METADATA
# title: Cloudtrail should be enabled in all regions regardless of where your AWS resources are generally homed
# description: |
#   Activity could be happening in your account in a different region. When creating Cloudtrail in the AWS Management Console the trail is configured by default to be multi-region, this isn't the case with the Terraform resource. Cloudtrail should cover the full AWS account to ensure you can track changes in regions you are not actively operting in.

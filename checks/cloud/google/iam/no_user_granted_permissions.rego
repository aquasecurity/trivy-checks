# METADATA
# title: IAM granted directly to user.
# description: |
#   Permissions should not be directly granted to users, you identify roles that contain the appropriate permissions, and then grant those roles to the user.
#
#   Granting permissions to users quickly become unwieldy and complex to make large scale changes to remove access to a particular resource.
#
#   Permissions should be granted on roles, groups, services accounts instead.

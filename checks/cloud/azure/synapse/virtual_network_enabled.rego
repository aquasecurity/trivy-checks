# METADATA
# title: Synapse Workspace should have managed virtual network enabled, the default is disabled.
# description: |
#   Synapse Workspace does not have managed virtual network enabled by default.
#
#   When you create your Azure Synapse workspace, you can choose to associate it to a Microsoft Azure Virtual Network. The Virtual Network associated with your workspace is managed by Azure Synapse. This Virtual Network is called a Managed workspace Virtual Network.
#
#   Managed private endpoints are private endpoints created in a Managed Virtual Network associated with your Azure Synapse workspace. Managed private endpoints establish a private link to Azure resources. You can only use private links in a workspace that has a Managed workspace Virtual Network.

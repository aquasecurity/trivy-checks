# METADATA
# title: ASG desires too much capacity
# description: |
#   This check ensures that an AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG) does not request an excessively large desired capacity.
#   A high desired capacity may lead to unnecessary costs and potential scaling issues.
#
#   Ensure that the desired capacity for Auto Scaling Groups is set to a reasonable value, typically within limits defined by your organization.

# METADATA
# title: Avoid using Python 2 as provider runtime
# description: |
#   Python 2 is deprecated and no longer receives security updates.
#   Using any version of Python 2 as the runtime for your provider poses significant risks,
#   including exposure to vulnerabilities and lack of support for modern libraries.
#
#   Ensure that you use a supported runtime version, such as Python 3.x,
#   to maintain the security and reliability of your serverless application.

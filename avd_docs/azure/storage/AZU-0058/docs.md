Geo-redundant storage (GRS) replicates your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
This provides an additional level of durability for your data in the event of a complete regional outage or a disaster.
Options include GRS, RAGRS, GZRS, and RAGZRS for geo-redundancy.
